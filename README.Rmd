# Analysis of my tastes on films <img src="f_a_logo.jpeg" align="right" width="300" />

**`Everything here is under development, so it may change over time. You are not looking at the final version of this project.`**

In this repository there will be stored all the material related to the analysis of *(my)* tastes on films. According to my current plans, different working methods will be addressed. My ultimate goal is to practice, have fun, and maybe draw some interesting conclusions.

## Contents

All the code and the useful files will be stored in folders according to the different parts of the analysis. In each folder there will also be a pdf file (automatically generated by R Markdown) with the comments of the obtained results.

- **`0 - Preface`**: description of the problem and of the dataset.

- **`1 - Web Scraping with Python`**: how the dataset has been built.

- **`2 - Cluster analysis with R`**: k-means, hierarchical clustering, PAM, mixture models, robust clustering methods and others.

- **`3 - Variable selection and dimension reduction with R`**: best subset selection, forward selection, backward elimination, Lasso, principal components regresion, partial least squares regression, index construction and others.

- **`4 - Comparison of the results and final considerations`**.

- **`[...]`**
